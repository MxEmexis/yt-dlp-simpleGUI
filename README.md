# yt-dlp simpleGUI
Simple GUI to interact with the yt-dlp command-line downloader.

## How it works
This program dowloads the *yt-dlp* binary from [yt-dlp repositories](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and interacts with it using a simple interface built using Python with Tkinter libraries.

For seeing the shell messages, run it via terminal using `./yt-dlp_simpleGUI`

I will add more features to it later, but at the moment it can download MP3 audio and MP4 video using pre-set flags, and also update the yt-dlp binary.

## Windows and Linux
At the moment only the Linux executable is avaliable, the Windows version will come soon.
