Still need to think of a better way to make the cookie check, the current
implementation works but looks bad to maintain when more options get included. (resolving this in 0.0.3)

Now I will need to duplicate the code for both the simple download and the
save-to-file option, but the code looks better now

Solving a bug with the save-to-file feature, currently it downloads the file in the same folder
as the program and creates a empty file on the target directory...bruh

I think that it's best to make the user set the variable for the filepath and then make the
output to the specified location.

Finally managed to make a better implementation of the download process that solves both issues, neat!

Only visual shenanigans and more comment snippets, nothing changed in the code itself for now.
